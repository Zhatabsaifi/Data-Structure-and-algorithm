Sum in each row & each column = 3*(32+1)/2 = 15

  2  21  20  14   8
 25  19  13   7   1

Sum in each row & each column = 5*(52+1)/2 = 65


In any magic square, the first number i.e. 1 is stored at position (n/2, n-1). Let this position be (i,j). The next number is stored at position (i-1, j+1) 
where we can consider each row & column as circular array i.e. they wrap around.


Three conditions hold:
1. The position of next number is calculated by decrementing row number of the previous number by 1, and incrementing the column number of the previous number by 1. 
    At any time, if the calculated row position becomes -1, it will wrap around to n-1. Similarly, if the calculated column position becomes n, it will wrap around to 0.
2. If the magic square already contains a number at the calculated position, calculated column position will be decremented by 2, and calculated row position will be 
    incremented by 1.
3. If the calculated row position is -1 & calculated column position is n, the new position would be: (0, n-2).

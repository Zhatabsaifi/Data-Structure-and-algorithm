There are N stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. 
Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).

Note: Order does not matter means for n=4 {1 2 1},{2 1 1},{1 1 2} are considered same.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: You can reach 4th stair in
3 ways.
3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2

1) method

long long countWay(int n){
   vector<int> dp(n+1 , 1);             // initalize dp arry with 1

    for(int i=2 ; i<=n ; i++){
        dp[i]=dp[i]+dp[i-2];
     }

    return dp[n];
}




2 ) method
long long countWays(int m){
    return (m/2 +1);
}

Given an integer N denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time 
is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.



time - O(n)
space - O(n)

//Complete this function
int maximizeTheCuts(int n, int x, int y, int z)
{
    //Your code here
    vector<int> dp(n+1,-1);
    dp[0]=0;
    
    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
        if(dp[i] == -1) {
            continue;
        }
        if(i+x <=n ){
            dp[i+x] = max(dp[i+x] , dp[i]+1);
        }
        if(i +y <= n){
            dp[i+y] = max(dp[i+y] , dp[i]+1);
        }
        if(i+z <= n){
            dp[i+z] = max(dp[i+z] , dp[i]+1);
        }
    }
    if(dp[n] == -1) return 0;
    return dp[n];
}

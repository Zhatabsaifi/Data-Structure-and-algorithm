The shortest path problem is about finding a path between  vertices in a graph such that the total sum of the edges weights is minimum.

Floyd\u2013Warshall's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between between all pairs of vertices in a graph, where each edge in the graph has a weight 
which is positive or negative. The biggest advantage of using this algorithm is that all the shortest distances between any  vertices could be calculated in O(v^3),
where V is the number of vertices in a graph.

time - O(V^3)

for(int k = 1; k <= n; k++){
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++){
            dist[i][j] = min( dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] );
        }
    }
}
